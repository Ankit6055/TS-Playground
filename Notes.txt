Typescript is not about reinventing javascript, It's just the superset which provides Type Safety

what typescript does: Static checking
Analyze the code as we type. That's it!

TS is a development tool, our project still runs JS 

Types: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Void, Object, Array, Tuples...
       Any, Never, unknown...

Situations: A function accept 2 numbers, A function returns a string

Syntax: let variableName: type = value; All the types are lowercase in TS
